Requirements for/Steps to run the Project:
1. Google Authenticator App is required on your smartphone.
2. Python libraries used in the project are to be installed (I have included a subprocess method to install the libraries in my python code so the libraries should get automatically installed when the code is run).
3. sqlite3 is a inbuilt module for python3 and hence I did not include a install command for it.
4. When the main python file is run (app.py), system will check and install libraries that are not already installed and hence the url for the host is lost in the command line. Please scroll up a little to get the host URL ( Here is the host link in case you don't find it : http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
5. Please use 'python3 app.py' command to run the python file. Using 'python app.py' might throw a error.
